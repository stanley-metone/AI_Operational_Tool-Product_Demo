# Capstone Week 10 Update

## How did AI accelerate my Capstone development this week?

AI accelerated my development by helping me move quickly from an operational problem to a working implementation. I used AI assistance to break the problem into validation rules, design a simple project structure, generate the first version of the Python logic, identify edge cases, write tests, and improve the documentation. This reduced the amount of time I spent on boilerplate and gave me more time to focus on whether the feature was useful and understandable for an operations user.

## What specific feature did I build using Vibe Coding?

I built an automated operations data-quality and SLA validation component. The feature reads a daily CSV of tickets or incidents, checks required fields, detects duplicate record IDs, validates statuses and priorities, calculates resolution or ticket age, flags SLA breaches, and produces an exception file plus a management-ready Markdown report. This component can be reused inside my Capstone as the first validation step before analysis or reporting.

## What was one challenge you faced in prompting the AI, and how did you overcome it?

One challenge was that broad prompts produced code that was more complicated than I needed. Early suggestions included extra frameworks and dependencies that would make the project harder to explain and demo. I improved the prompts by adding tighter constraints: use Python 3.10+, keep dependencies minimal, run locally, avoid paid APIs, separate fatal input errors from normal business exceptions, and make every output easy to demonstrate within three minutes. Those constraints produced a simpler and more reliable solution that matched the assignment better.
